Title: Do This First
Writer: Daphne Link

Just slow down no need to speed up
I ask questions to create a speed bump
Every word you say my soul heats up
I'm praying I say the right things to keep up

When it's time for us to leave
There's something in us we both perceive
So obvious none of this is rehearsed
Then you whispered do this first


star
sky
night
leave
stay
