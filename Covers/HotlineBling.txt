Title: Hotline Bling | Writer: Daphne Link
Original by Drake  

I used to call you on your
I used to, I used to, yeah

I used to call you on your cell phone
Wasn't 'cause I needed your love
Called you on your cell phone
Wasn't 'cause I needed your love

Just because that hotline bling
That don't mean what you think
Just because that hotline bling
That don't mean what you think

Ever since you left the city, I
Got a reputation for myself now
Everybody knows how you feel left out
It's not my problem, so go on and pout

Cause ever since you left the city, I 
Started feeling blessed and giving more
I don't have much, so I build rapport
Things I never did when you were mi amor

I used to call you on your cell phone
Wasn't 'cause I needed your love
Called you on your cell phone
Wasn't 'cause I needed your love

Just because that hotline bling
That don't mean what you think
Just because that hotline bling
That don't mean what you think

Ever since you left the city, I, I, I
I tried to be your friend, I wasn't strong
Let's not pretend you didn't do me wrong
Now you're mad that I've withdrawn
Ever since you left the city, I
Got more than I was asking for
Glad you left and I opened a new door
Now I have real friends I truly adore

I used to call you on your cell phone
Wasn't 'cause I needed your love
Called you on your cell phone
Wasn't 'cause I needed your love

Just because that hotline bling
That don't mean what you think
Just because that hotline bling
That don't mean what you think

These days, all you do is
Wonder if I'm giving all my love away to someone else
Wonder if I'm spending all my time on someone else
Doing things I taught you but being classy with someone else
I don't need no one else
But I have someone else, yeah
For a time I was alone
It's my life you didn't need to know
I think it's time you let go, give it a whirl
Go, like a tornado, yeah
Because I'm just being me
The real me you refused to see

I used to call you on your cell phone
Wasn't 'cause I needed your love
Called you on your cell phone
Wasn't 'cause I needed your love

Just because that hotline bling
That don't mean what you think
Just because that hotline bling
That don't mean what you think

Ever since you left the city
