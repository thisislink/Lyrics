Title: Hotline Bling | Writer: Daphne Link
Original by Drake  

I used to call you on your
I used to, I used to, yeah

I used to call you on your cell phone
Wasn't 'cause I needed your love
Called you on your cell phone
Wasn't 'cause I needed your love

Just because that hotline bling
That don't mean what you think
Just because that hotline bling
That don't mean what you think

Ever since you left the city, I
Got a reputation for myself now
Everybody knows how you feel left out
It's not my problem, so go on and pout

Cause ever since you left the city, I 
Started feeling blessed and giving more
I don't have much, so I build rapport
Things I never did when you were mi amor

I used to call you on your cell phone
Wasn't 'cause I needed your love
Called you on your cell phone
Wasn't 'cause I needed your love

Just because that hotline bling
That don't mean what you think
Just because that hotline bling
That don't mean what you think

Ever since you left the city, I, I, I
I tried to be your friend even though I wasn't strong
Let's stop pretending you didn't do me wrong
Now you're mad that I've withdrawn
Ever since you left the city, I
Got more than I was asking for
Glad you left and I opened a new door
Now I have real friends I truly adore

I used to call you on your cell phone
Wasn't 'cause I needed your love
Called you on your cell phone
Wasn't 'cause I needed your love

Just because that hotline bling
That don't mean what you think
Just because that hotline bling
That don't mean what you think
