Title: Where Are You Now (cover rewrite) | Writer: Daphne Link
Original Song: Hands On Me by Darius Rucker

You crossed my mind today
I know it's almost your birthday
I don't really think that's why
It's because we never said bye

Our memories were all good
But then we hit adulthood
Conversations slowly faded
Much like dreams we painted

My hope is one day we'll meet again
You'll talk about all the places you've been
But I don't know when, where, or how
So I'm here wondering where are you now

I wonder if you went to San Fran
It seemed like a solid plan
Or maybe you changed your mind
Went to Hollywood, left it all behind

Hope you kept your optimism
You were the spectrum from a prism

My hope is one day we'll meet again
You'll talk about all the places you've been
But I don't know when, where, or how
So I'm here wondering where are you now

Hope you kept your optimism
You were the spectrum from a prism

Where are you now
Where are you now
Where are you now
Where are you now

My hope is one day we'll meet again
You'll talk about all the places you've been
But I don't know when, where, or how
So I'm here wondering where are you now
So I'm here wondering where are you now
