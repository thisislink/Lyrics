Title: Real Friends (cover rewrite)
Writer: Daphne Link
Original song by Camila Cabello

Yeah I'm gonna go out tonight
Have some conversations about our lives
Yeah I know you hate your wife
So I'll say the words to help you through the strife

This is why I try
This is the reason why
I love to be a friend by your side
We don't switch sides or draw the line
We just like to keep an open mind

I found a few real friends
Try my best not to let them down
But sometimes things happen
And a heart feels saddened

I found a few real friends 
So when I feel like hiding out
They understand I'm an introvert
Back again I'll be, no doubt

It's been 5 years this June
Since I've had a date with someone new
My friends say it's time I try, yeah
I say it'll happen all in good time

I found a few real friends
Try my best not to let them down
But sometimes things happen
And a heart feels saddened

I found a few real friends 
So when I feel like hiding out
They understand I'm an introvert
Back again I'll be, no doubt

Now don't get me wrong
When you listen to the words in this song
Along the way a friend might go
In the meantime enjoy the rodeo

When they go and it hits your heart
You know they made a mark
These friends will make you feel blessed
When memories are the only thing left

I found a few real friends
Try my best not to let them down
But sometimes things happen
And a heart feels saddened

I found a few real friends 
So when I feel like hiding out
They understand I'm an introvert
Back again I'll be, no doubt
