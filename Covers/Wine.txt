Title: Wine (Cover Rewrite) | Writer: Daphne Link
Original song Mine by Bazzi

Yeah, no I haven't had anything to drink
Just gotta tell you about one

Look
There's just something special about your style
When I see you I can't help but smile
You can't help but try to hide behind the label
Your plan make me unstable with

Wine
One hand on your body slow pouring the Merlot
Sipping on you from a thin rim bordeaux
You're never uptight
Always empty by the end of the night
You're wine
