Title: Wine (Cover Rewrite) | Writer: Daphne Link
Original song Mine by Bazzi

Yeah, no I haven't had anything to drink
Just gotta tell you about one

Look
There's just something special about your style
When I see you I can't help but smile
You can't help but try to hide behind the label
Your plan make me unstable with

Wine
One hand on your body slow pouring the Merlot
Sipping on you from a thin rim bordeaux
You're never uptight
Always empty by the end of the night
You're wine
Don't you see
I'm thirsty

Why are you so smooth and full of variety?
I can't imagine anything better, you're quality
You feel pressure from the cork you had
But tonight you let loose, you're glad

I'll chill you to the right temp
This is a you and me event
All night
Even if I'm passed out by midnight
There's no better way to drink

Wine
One hand on your body slow pouring the Merlot
Sipping on you from a thin rim bordeaux
You're never uptight
Always empty by the end of the night
You're wine
Don't you see
I'm thirsty
