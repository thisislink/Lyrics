Title: Love Me (cover rewrite)
Writer: Daphne Link
Original song by Forest Blakk

I thought I knew it all
At 21 I was standing tall
And by 25 I wanted to end it all
My heartbreak had sent me awol

I eventually got my act together
Found someone new, thought I was better
I was hiding behind the broken parts
I hadn't yet discovered I was a fine art

I needed to love me
I needed to know
If I really loved me crazy
Love me, love me, love me crazy
It was time to let it show
