Title: Love Me (cover rewrite)
Writer: Daphne Link
Original song by Forest Blakk

I thought I knew it all
At 21 I was standing tall
And by 25 I wanted to end it all
My heartbreak had sent me awol

I eventually got my act together
Found someone new, thought I was better
I was hiding behind the broken parts
I hadn't yet discovered I was a fine art

I needed to love me
I needed to know
If I really loved me crazy
Love me, love me, love me crazy
It was time to let it show

There was nothing better than Friday night
The liquor was my life line
I wanted to be greater
I had gotten that college paper
Was this the last stop?

See I still didn't know
This wasn't the end of the road
I was impatient in the present
I hadn't yet discovered
I was still learning some lessons

I needed to love me
I needed to know
If I really loved me crazy
Love me, love me, love me crazy
It was time to let it show

I needed to love me
I needed to know
If I really loved me crazy
Love me, love me, love me crazy
It was time to let it show

I've had some time to contemplate
I embrace being my own shipmate
At times I don't know what I'm doing
That's when I pray for a mental renewing

The best part is looking back
I can see it's led me to where I'm at
I'd go back and do it all again
Because I know there's a rainbow after the pain

I needed to love me
I needed to know
If I really loved me crazy
Love me, love me, love me crazy
It was time to let it show

I needed to love me
I needed to know
If I really loved me crazy
Love me, love me, love me crazy
It was time to let it show

I needed to love me
I needed to know
If I really loved me crazy
Love me, love me, love me crazy
It was time to let it show

I needed to love me
I needed to know
If I really loved me crazy
Love me, love me, love me crazy
It was time to let it show

I needed to love me
I needed to know
If I really loved me crazy
Love me, love me, love me crazy
It was time to let it show

If I really loved me crazy
Love me, love me, love me crazy
It was time to let it show
