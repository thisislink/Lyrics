Title: Visalia
Writer: Daphne Link
Original song by Camila Cabello

Visalia ooo na na
Half of my heart is in Visalia ooo na na
Met outta town at a coffee shop na na na
But my heart is in Visalia
There's somethin' 'bout her candor
Visalia ooo na na

When I saw you I knew we'd be friends
(That's where it all begins)
Hanging with you every weekend
(I started to catch somethin')
I could feel the feelings creepin'
(Possibly headed for a dead end)

Ooh-ooh-ooh I knew it when I met her
I loved her when I left her
Had me feelin' like
Ooh-ooh-ooh, but it got so late
I had to get back home 
oh na na na na na

Visalia ooo na na
Half of my heart is in Visalia ooo na na
Met outta town at a coffee shop na na na
But my heart is in Visalia
My heart is in Visalia
Visalia ooo na na

(rap here?)



Visalia ooo na na
Half of my heart is in Visalia ooo na na
Met outta town at a coffee shop na na na
But my heart is in Visalia
My heart is in Visalia
Visalia ooo na na
