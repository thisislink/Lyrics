Title: Visalia
Writer: Daphne Link
Original song by Camila Cabello

Visalia ooo na na
Half of my heart is in Visalia ooo na na
Met outta town at a coffee shop na na na
But my heart is in Visalia
There's somethin' 'bout her candor
Visalia ooo na na

When I saw you I knew we'd be friends
(That's where it all begins)
Hanging with you every weekend
(I started to catch somethin')
I could feel the feelings creepin'
(Maybe headed for a dead end)
I was trying hard to ignore 'em
But risking looking dumb

Ooh-ooh-ooh I knew it when I met her
I loved her when I left her
Had me feelin' like
Ooh-ooh-ooh, but it got late
I had to get back home 
oh na na na na na

Visalia ooo na na
Half of my heart is in Visalia ooo na na
Met outta town at a coffee shop na na na
But my heart is in Visalia
My heart is in Visalia
Visalia ooo na na

Daphne
Living in Central California mm 
Too many dreams and "I'm gonnas" damn
Too many dreams
When I met her, sparked a fire in me
And made me see where I wanna be
Now writing songs is my thing
Telling stories about everything (everything)
From avo tacos and slot machines
When I write anything is a possibility
Rhymes have you jumping, trampoline
This is history in the making for me
Beginning of the awakening baby
Just wait, you're gonna see

Visalia ooo na na
Half of my heart is in Visalia ooo na na
Met outta town at a coffee shop na na na
But my heart is in Visalia
My heart is in Visalia
Visalia ooo na na

Ooh na-na, oh na-na-na 
Take me back, back, back like
Ooh na-na, oh na-na-na
I'm going back, back back like
Ooh na-na, oh na-na-na 
Take me back, back, back like
Ooh na-na, oh na-na-na
I'm going back, back back like

Ooh-ooh-ooh Ooh-ooh-ooh
I went back to Visalia

Visalia ooo na na
Half of my heart is in Visalia ooo na na
Met outta town at a coffee shop na na na
But my heart is in Visalia
My heart is in Visalia
Visalia ooo na na

Ooo na-na-na (ooo na, yeah)
Ooo na-na-na
Ooo na-na-na
Visalia ooo na na
