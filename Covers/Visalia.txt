Title: Visalia
Writer: Daphne Link
Original song by Camila Cabello

Visalia ooo na na
Half of my heart is in Visalia ooo na na
Met at a sweet coffee spot na na na
But my heart is in Visalia
There's somethin' 'bout her candor
Visalia ooo na na





Ooh-ooh-ooh I knew it when I met her
I loved her when I left her
Had me feelin' like
Ooh-ooh-ooh, and it got so late
I had to get back home 
oh na na na na na




Visalia ooo na na
Half of my heart is in Visalia ooo na na
Met at a sweet coffee spot na na na
But my heart is in Visalia
My heart is in Visalia
Visalia ooo na na

Visalia ooo na na
Half of my heart is in Visalia ooo na na
Met at a sweet coffee spot na na na
But my heart is in Visalia
My heart is in Visalia
Visalia ooo na na
