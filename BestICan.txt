Title: Best I Can
Writer: Daphne Link

I try to put in a lot of effort
It's obvious I'm no expert
You remind me I'm not less than
So I continue doing the best I can

Sometimes the dragons come out of nowhere
But you got my back, my own adult daycare
I tried to live like I was in a fantasy
It left me empty only caring about vanity

I try to put in a lot of effort
It's obvious I'm no expert
You remind me I'm not less than
So I continue doing the best I can
