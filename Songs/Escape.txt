Title: Escape
Writer: Daphne Link

Someone once told you take a seat
That you have heart but can't compete
You didn't believe them though
You practiced your talent, Michelangelo

Everyday you roll the dice
You're going after your own paradise
You're destined to do more than escape
You let the light in and open the drapes
