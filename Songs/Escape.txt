Title: Escape
Writer: Daphne Link

Someone once told you take a seat
That you have heart but can't compete
You didn't believe them though
You practiced your talent, Michelangelo

So everyday you roll the dice
You're going after your own paradise
You're destined to do more than escape
You let the light in and open the drapes

At times you felt lost, no passion
But you kept grinding, making it happen
You like to work but love to play
You combined the two, new kinda risque

So everyday you roll the dice
You're going after your own paradise
You're destined to do more than escape
You let the light in and open the drapes

So everyday you roll the dice
You're going after your own paradise
You're destined to do more than escape
You let the light in and open the drapes
