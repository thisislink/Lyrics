Title: With Patience
Writer: Daphne Link

I make sure I have no expectations
Just determination with patience
Cause I know life's like spaghetti
But I know one day there'll be confetti

So in the comments when there's a butcher
Cutting people down word killer
They don't know the jokes on them
They have no power to condemn

meat
joke
funny
cowboy
horse
