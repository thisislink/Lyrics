Title: Short Of Amazing
Writer: Daphne Link

Together we planted a garden
Secretly knowing we'd stay guarded
You saw a future with a good wife
I saw days without you, a new life

We were broken and always complaining
For each other we were short of amazing
There were times we never felt more alive
But mostly we were emotionally deprived
