Title: Short Of Amazing
Writer: Daphne Link


Too broken and always complaining
For each other we were short of amazing


Together we planted a garden
Secretly saying we would stay guarded
You saw a future with a good wife
I saw days without you, a new life



life
death
evening
barber
cut
police
faith
