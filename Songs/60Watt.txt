Title: 60 Watt
Writer: Daphne Link


hour

time
wood
forest
serene

Page one was a little dark
Somewhere along page 50 I made my mark
I worked to be more than a wannabe
Made each of my dreams a reality

I turned the page and there you were
At times I'm still a little too immature
Good thing you don't seem to mind
Cause my heart feels it's the right time

Meeting you I feel blessed
And there's something I want to suggest
I know asking may be a long shot
But will you be my 60 watt?

Each choice I made I can now see
Was a story to get where I needed to be
