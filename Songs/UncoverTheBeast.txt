Title: Uncover The Beast
Writer: Daphne Link

Looking back you fell into a lot of traps
So called friends steped back and clapped
Oh yeah they really became your #1 fans
Blew through your life like breeze in the sand

Now you're fine, you have a compass
A guide north through all the ruckus

Learning to ignore the lies and deceit
You're putting the positivity on repeat
It's time for a self love feast
Pull back the sheet, uncover the beast

Today you were upset by human rejection
Sent you spinning in the wrong direction

Now you're fine, you have a compass
A guide north through all the ruckus

Learning to ignore the lies and deceit
You're putting the positivity on repeat
It's time for a self love feast
Pull back the sheet, uncover the beast
