Title: Love You Any Less
Writer: Daphne Link

I know my words hit you like frostbite
So our disagreement turned into a fight
Now you're downing another screwdriver
And you feel like setting me on fire

We're in the twelfth round of this bout
I'm ready to throw in the towel, knockout

I say right now we're on a rollercoaster
But I just want to go to sleep and wake up closer
I say right now we're a mess 
But I don't want to love you any less

In the moment I tell you I quit
Your eyeroll tells me 'you don't mean it'
I stop before I go 100 on the word freeway
I think a minute so you don't walk away

We're in the twelfth round of this bout
I'm ready to throw in the towel, knockout

I say right now we're on a rollercoaster
But I just want to go to sleep and wake up closer
I say right now we're a mess 
But I don't want to love you any less

We're in the twelfth round of this bout
I'm ready to throw in the towel, knockout

I say right now we're on a rollercoaster
But I just want to go to sleep and wake up closer
I say right now we're a mess 
But I don't want to love you any less
