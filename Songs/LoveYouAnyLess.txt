Title: Love You Any Less
Writer: Daphne Link

I know my words hit you like frostbite
So our disagreement turned into a fight
Now you're downing another screwdriver
And you feel like setting me on fire

In the moment I say I wanna quit
Your eyeroll says 'I want you to mean it'
I stop before I go 100 on the word freeway
I think a minute so you don't walk away

I say right now we're on a rollercoaster
But I just want to go to sleep and wake up closer
I say right now we're a mess 
But I don't want to love you any less

We both see this 
tools
snail
slow
