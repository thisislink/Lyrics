Title: Mold Me
Writer: Daphne Link

When it came to love
I was a late bloomer
Fairytales about true love
I wish I'd known the truth sooner

I'm not what I dreamed I'd be
But here I am, take me mold me
I don't know what's in store
But you can be my mentor

It's taken time to own my mistakes
At times causing my own heartbreaks
It's time to set fire to the flames
I'm ready to hand you the reins

I'm not what I dreamed I'd be
But here I am, take me mold me
I don't know what's in store
But you can be my mentor

There's no denying you're the O.G.
There's no denying you're the O.G.
Yeah
There's no denying you're the O.G.
Yeah

(Instrumental)

I'm not what I dreamed I'd be
But here I am, take me mold me
I don't know what's in store
But you can be my mentor
