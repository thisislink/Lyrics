Title: Familiar Encounter
Writer: Daphne Link

At the party you took my coat
One look I had a lump in my throat

You've never been one to gloat
That's why you don't mention your boat
I tell you stop being so modest
We just met so please honest

It's only been an hour
But this is a familiar encounter
I just need one more
Then I'll know for sure
