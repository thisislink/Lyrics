Title: Familiar Encounter
Writer: Daphne Link

You've never been one to gloat
That's why you don't mention your boat
I tell you stop being so modest
We just met so please honest

It's only been an hour
But this is a familiar encounter
I just need one more
Then I'll know for sure

Things have escalated quickly
I don't wanna wake up feeling guilty
You're trying to get me in bed
I'm praying to God 'help me not be misled'

It's only been an hour
But this is a familiar encounter
I just need one more
Then I'll know for sure

I'm not convinced we haven't met
This feels old like a video cassette

Yeah, I'm not convinced we haven't met
This feels old like a video cassette

It's only been an hour
But this is a familiar encounter
I just need one more
Then I'll know for sure
