Title: Fall For Me
Writer: Daphne Link

We're on our way to becoming better
So when we meet we're ready to be lovers
We won't have to come to a screeching halt
We'll keep our secrets safe in a vault

If the door is locked I'll give you the key
So you can open it and fall for me
We'll come together individually complete
So our love will never be bittersweet
