Title: How Do You Know
Writer: Daphne Link

How do you know when things go right
Tomorrow they won't blow up like dynamite?
How do you know when you cross the bridge
You won't get to the end of walk off the edge?

You don't know
You're all in going with the flow
You're taking a leap of faith, eyes closed
Arms open and feeling completely exposed

How do you know when you pray and say amen
Whether or not He's really listening?
How do you know when you're no longer young
You still have a future, you're not done?

You don't know
You're all in going with the flow
You're taking a leap of faith, eyes closed
Arms open and feeling completely exposed

How do you know when to go in for the kiss
You're not too fast, football blitz?
How do you know your love is still strong
When they respond to you clearly withdrawn?

You don't know
You're all in going with the flow
You're taking a leap of faith, eyes closed
Arms open and feeling completely exposed

How do you know? How can you know?
How do you know? How can you know?

You don't know
You're all in going with the flow
You're taking a leap of faith, eyes closed
Arms open and feeling completely exposed

You're taking a leap of faith, eyes closed
Arms open and feeling completely exposed
