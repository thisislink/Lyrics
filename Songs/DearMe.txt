Title: Dear Me
Writer: Daphne Link

Wherever you go use your manners
Remember being kind is what matters
Always keep your sense of humor
Go ahead and relax about your future


Say these words to put your mind at ease
In a letter that starts with dear me
You can say these words when you feel down
But you still want to wear the crown
