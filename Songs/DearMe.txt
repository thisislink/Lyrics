Title: Dear Me
Writer: Daphne Link

Wherever you go use your manners
Remember being kind is what matters
Always keep your sense of humor
Go ahead and relax about your future

Say these words to put your mind at ease
In a letter that starts with dear me
You can say these words if you ever feel down
But you know you still wanna wear the crown

If you ever forget you're magnificent
I want you to know I love you're different
Remember when life throws you another obstacle
Only not trying makes things impossible

Say these words to put your mind at ease
In a letter that starts with dear me
You can say these words if you ever feel down
But you know you still wanna wear the crown

You still wanna wear the crown
You still wanna wear the crown, yeah

Say these words to put your mind at ease
In a letter that starts with dear me
You can say these words if you ever feel down
But you know you still wanna wear the crown
