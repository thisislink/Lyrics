Title: Simple Decisions
Writer: Daphne Link

I was stirring my coffee and cream
And falling in love with a daydream
No portfolio needed for my next move
Win or lose, either way I'll improve

Sometimes it's the simple decisions
That bring complications to our ambitions
But once we decide to turn the page
We'll be living in our own golden age

Everyday I'm a little more unchained
Putting myself out there unashamed
I'm escaping indecision island
One step closer to mining diamonds

Sometimes it's the simple decisions
That bring complications to our ambitions
But once we decide to turn the page
We'll be living in our own golden age
