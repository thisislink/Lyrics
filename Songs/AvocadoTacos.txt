Title: Avocado Tacos
Writer: Daphne Link

When I go to the store
I go for one thing
I don't eat meat
So it's not buffalo wings

Only one green fruit
I crave in this life
Worst part is waiting
For them to get ripe

So, I'll pass on the nachos
I just want avocado tacos
Feel the flavor flow in my veins
It's the taste of magic I can't explain

I'll pass on the nachos
I just want avocado tacos
Feel the flavor flow in my veins
It's the taste of magic I can't explain
