Title: Showing You My Love Is Clear
Writer: Daphne Link

When we met again I was older
I've been on some wild rides, rollercoaster
We talked about times I felt incomplete
Things I only share with you, I dare not repeat

Life is moving fast but we speak daily
When I'm afraid you pull me into safety

I feel like I'm swinging from a chandelier
You said "I'm showing you my love is clear"
I told you I can't do this
But the more I know you I can't resist

Some days I just go to you and complain
I'm sorry, forgive me if I give you a migraine
You ask I find the beauty in the pain
You insist I give it to you and see what I gain

Life is moving fast but we speak daily
When I'm afraid you pull me into safety

I feel like I'm swinging from a chandelier
You said "I'm showing you my love is clear"
I told you I can't do this
But the more I know you I can't resist
