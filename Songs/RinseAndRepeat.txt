Title: Rinse And Repeat
Writer: Daphne Link

I'm ready to rest for the day
But also hungry the stage, screenplay
I don't always like the words I write 
But I put them out to see what will ignite

I'm just one lady
Trying something new daily
My m.o. is being discreet
So I give just enough, rinse and repeat

Writing lyrics has become a joy
Feel free to call me the real mccoy
Sometimes when I write a chorus
I make my own rules, a nonconformist

I'm just one lady
Trying something new daily
My m.o. is being discreet
So I give just enough, rinse and repeat

I'm just one lady
Trying something new daily
My m.o. is being discreet
So I give just enough, rinse and repeat
