I’m making sure my heart is open
Because I can see your love is golden
There’s no reason to pretend
Because I knew we’d be more than friends

Being with you is a cruise
You never leave me feeling bruised
Trivial material isn’t what I seek
I’m on a voyage to the highest peak 

When I’m feeling frantic
You always pull out the word magic
You know just how to sink my doubt
That’s why I’m on your hook like a trout

Being with you is a cruise
You never leave me feeling bruised
Trivial material isn’t what I seek
I’m on a voyage to the highest peak 

Repeat Chorus until end
