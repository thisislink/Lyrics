Title: Perfect
Writer: Daphne Link

This is a place you can feel safe
Whenever you feel like resting

You wanted to leave this place
Go where you don't feel like a disgrace

You thought you had all you could handle
But it's a new day with a new scandal

Your past chases you like a shadow
Wanna change the station new channel

You have butterflies in your stomach
You don't dare say how you feel in public
As soon as you do they'll say counterfeit
Just like that your heart takes a hit

When you get a letter in the mail
For a second you're living in a fairytale
