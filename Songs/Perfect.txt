Title: Perfect
Writer: Daphne Link

You have butterflies in your stomach
You don't dare say how you feel in public
As soon as you do they'll say counterfeit
And just like that your heart takes a hit

But there's a place you can feel safe
Whenever you feel like resting
A place you get to be the architect
In this place everything's perfect

It's a new day with a new scandal
You've had all you could handle
You've dreamed of leaving this place
Going where you don't feel like a disgrace

But there's a place you can feel safe
Whenever you feel like resting
A place you get to be the architect
In this place everything's perfect

Your past has chased you like a shadow
Wanna change the station to a new channel

But there's a place you can feel safe
Whenever you feel like resting
A place you get to be the architect
In this place everything's perfect
