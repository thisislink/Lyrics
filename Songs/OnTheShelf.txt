Title: On The Shelf
Writer: Daphne Link

In my 20s I felt so lost
I’d go back now and tell myself to pause
I’d go back now and tell myself to breathe
Things get better, don’t seethe

Remember life starts as a win
That first breath is how you begin

It was eleven past twelve
When I found myself on the shelf
I dusted off my pages
Started telling my story in stages

Take a minute to consume this tune
Give it a minute to make you swoon
In due time you’ll be more wise
In the meantime be cautious of lies

Remember life starts as a win
That first breath is how you begin

It was eleven past twelve
When I found myself on the shelf
I dusted off my pages
Started telling my story in stages
