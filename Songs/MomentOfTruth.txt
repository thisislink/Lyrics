Title: Moment Of Truth
Writer: Daphne Link


When we met we spoke in riddles
Before we knew it nothing was simple
Was that sweet kiss just a dream?
Reality, fantasy either way I wanna scream



needle

deck
queen of hearts
scream
formula
calculus

This is the moment of truth
Will we hit a homerun babe ruth?
Do we keep our cards close to our chest?
Words unspoken, love unconfessed
