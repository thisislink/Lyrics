Title: Embrace The Unknown
Writer: Daphne Link

I've never been a fan of farewell
Because life's kinda like a carousel
And I've always been a fan of popcorn
The unique shape reminds me of a unicorn

So when I'm ten feet deep in the struggle
And the rain tries to drown me in a puddle
I'll take a moment to embrace the unknown
And prepare to receive my capstone
