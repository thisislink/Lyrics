Title: Your Name Or The Season

In the summer I was in a hammock
With you around I was aerodynamic
Reading books and sipping tea
You brought the calm to my sea

But no more, I can't stand it
The tornado comes wreaks havoc

I could never decide which I loved
Your name or the season
So I'll have another whiskey sour
I'll still be here after happy hour
