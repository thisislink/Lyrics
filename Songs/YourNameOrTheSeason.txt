Title: Your Name Or The Season

In the summer I was in a hammock
With you around I was aerodynamic
Reading books and sipping tea
You brought the calm to my sea

But no more, now I can't stand it
The tornado comes wreaks havoc

I could never decide which I loved
Was it your name or the season?
So I'll have another whiskey sour
And I'll be here drinking my demons

In the autumn I was in the country
No money and no car was most humbling
