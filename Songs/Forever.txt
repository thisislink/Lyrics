Title: Forever
Writer: Daphne Link

Knife through my heart
When we fell apart
But looking back I remember forever
Obsession with you was my only pleasure

I still see your face without a picture
I'm even at peace without the liquor



I stopped by an old downtown gallery
A souvenir caught my eye like your personality
Right there, how I missed your love sank in
In that tiny store I was in a tailspin



scar
power
pilot
dinosaur
souvenir
