Title: Forever
Writer: Daphne Link

I stopped by an old downtown gallery
A souvenir caught my eye like your personality
Right there, how I miss your love sinks in
In that tiny store I was in a tailspin

I still see your face without a picture
I'm even at peace without the liquor

I remember the knife through my heart
Back when we fell apart
But looking back I also remember forever
Obsession with you was my only pleasure

I could be making dinner
It's when memories like to linger
Right there, how I miss your love sinks in
In my kitchen I'm in a tailspin

I still see your face without a picture
I'm even at peace without the liquor

I remember the knife through my heart
Back when we fell apart
But looking back I also remember forever
Obsession with you was my only pleasure

Right here, how I miss your love sinks in
In this life I'm in a tailspin

I still see your face without a picture
I'm even at peace without the liquor

I remember the knife through my heart
Back when we fell apart
But looking back I also remember forever
Obsession with you was my only pleasure

Right here, how I miss your love sinks in
In this life I'm in a tailspin
