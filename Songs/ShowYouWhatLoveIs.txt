Title: Showing You My Love Is Clear
Writer: Daphne Link

When we met again I was older
I've been on some wild rides, rollercoaster
We talked about times I felt incomplete
Things I only share with you, I dare not repeat

But life is moving fast and we speak daily
When I'm afraid you pull me into safety

I feel like I'm swinging from a chandelier
You said I'm showing you my love is clear
I told you I can't do this
But the more I know you I can't resist
