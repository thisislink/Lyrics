Title: Nickel Slots
Writer: Daphne Link

Let's go to Vegas
Where everything we'd do is shameless
Dancing all night, one or two shots
We'll make our way to the nickel slots

Let's go to Vegas
Let's go to Vegas

I'm ready to get outta here
Go where every moment is in high gear
There I can pretend to be mayor, or
Tell fake stories how I'm friends with Taylor

Let's go to Vegas
Where everything we'd do is shameless
Dancing all night, one or two shots
We'll make our way to the nickel slots

Let's go to Vegas
Let's go to Vegas

We'll hit up fancy restaurants
Spend hours passing by storefronts
We'll see people dressed like cowboys
And drink from alcohol filled toys

Let's go to Vegas
Where everything we'd do is shameless
Dancing all night, one or two shots
We'll make our way to the nickel slots

Let's go to Vegas
Let's go to Vegas
