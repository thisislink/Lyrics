Title: I Want You To Mean It
Writer: Daphne Link


flight

I know my words hit you like frostbite
So our disagreement turned into a fight
Now you're downing another screwdriver
And you feel like setting me on fire


tools
snail
slow

Right now we're on a rollercoaster
But I just want to go to sleep and wake up closer
Right now we're a mess 
But I don't want to love you any less
