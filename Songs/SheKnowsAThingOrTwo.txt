Title: She Knows A Thing Or Two
Writer: Daphne Link

How she dances you think she has no standards
You don't know you gotta step to her with manners
You walk over to her talking crazy
Start telling her she looks tasty

You get the feeling she's unimpressed
And you're thinking you failed the test

You try again asking to be the bullets to her gun
She says look I'm just not the one
You walk off 'cause you know you're through
You realize she knows a thing or two
