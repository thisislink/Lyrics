Title: Company
Writer: Daphne Link

I don't require much on my birthday
I'll take a good book, Hemingway
I don't even like the bar
Let's go on a long drive in your car

Only one thing I need guaranteed
Don't even mind if we disagree
Just don't leave me suddenly
Stay and keep me company


radar
cup
fountain
practice
tent
campfire
blanket
