Title: Company
Writer: Daphne Link

I don't require much on my birthday
I'll take a good book, Hemingway
I don't even like the bar
Let's go on a long drive in your car

Only one thing I need guaranteed
Don't even mind if we disagree
Just don't leave me suddenly
Stay and keep me company

Take this moment to sum things up
This is the good life of a grown up
Take this moment to sum things up
This is the good life of a grown up

Only one thing I need guaranteed
Don't even mind if we disagree
Just don't leave me suddenly
Stay and keep me company
