Title: Home To Me
Writer: Daphne Link

Summer days and sunglasses
Winter kisses filled with passion
Music up with the windows down
Nothing better than night drives around town

Just take a nap in park somewhere grassy
There's no need for anything classy

This is home to me
Every moment a blessing
Even when life's a mess
I put my trust in His process

You and friends singing favorite songs
3 to 4 minutes of people getting along
Candles burning in your house
Moments alone and no knows your whereabouts

Just take a nap in park somewhere grassy
There's no need for anything classy

This is home to me
Every moment a blessing
Even when life's a mess
I put my trust in His process
