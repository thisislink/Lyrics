Title: Home To Me
Writer: Daphne Link

Summer days and sunglasses
Winter kisses filled with passion
Music up with the windows down
Nothing better than night drives around town

Take a nap in park somewhere grassy
I don't need anything classy

This is home to me
Every moment a blessing
Even when life's a mess
I put my trust in His process


sled
snow
breath
life
