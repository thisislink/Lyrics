Title: Down To The Wire | Writer: Daphne Link

I don't know about you
But sometimes I don't have a clue
About where to go or how to start
Waiting until I feel it in my heart

When you're down to the wire
One of two things can happen
They can go good or backfire
So step up and be the captain

It's harder when I don't feel it
Stalls me from making a commitment
But time waits for no one
It pushes before you're ready to run

When you're down to the wire
One of two things can happen
They can go good or backfire
So step up and be the captain

When you're down to the wire
One of two things can happen
They can go good or backfire
So step up and be the captain
