Title: Love Wanted Signs | Writer: Daphne Link

You once had a lover
Said you'd be together forever
Said you could take it to the bank
But it all went blood red, shark tank

I can see it miles away
A broken world on display
People walking around feeling hollow
Love wanted signs everywhere I go

Grandmother passed and left some money
Suddenly your broken family is your buddy
People seem to care when life sunsets
Where's the love when you really need it

I can see it miles away
A broken world on display
People walking around feeling hollow
Love wanted signs everywhere I go

Let's stop doing this world a disservice
Let's live each day with more purpose

I can see it miles away
A broken world on display
People walking around feeling hollow
Love wanted signs everywhere I go

I can see it miles away
A broken world on display
People walking around feeling hollow
Love wanted signs everywhere I go
