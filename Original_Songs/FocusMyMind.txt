Title: Focus My Mind | Writer: Daphne Link

When everyday’s a grind
How do I focus my mind?
When I’m asked for advice
Do I have the words to be wise?

I never know what to do next
I’m living life rather perplexed 
I pray to do and know more
Than I’ve ever done or known before 

When people are anything but kind
How can I begin to focus my mind?
When good seems to have left the heart
Can you find it again with a chart?

I never know what to do next
I’m living life rather perplexed 
I pray to do and know more
Than I’ve ever done or known before

When I’m wishing you were here
How do I turn it around to feel cheer?
How do I focus my mind
When I’m feel left behind?

I never know what to do next
I’m living life rather perplexed 
I pray to do and know more
Than I’ve ever done or known before
