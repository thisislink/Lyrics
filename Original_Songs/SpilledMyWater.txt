Title: Spilled My Water | Writer: Daphne Link

Sometimes it’s the little things
That give us wings
Sometimes it takes drowning
To let go of all our doubting

So today I spilled my water
I could see I had something to offer
In the middle of the watery mess
I could see I was blessed

You should be your biggest fan
You’re one of a kind, no scam
When you need to take a step back
Remember how far you’ve come,
you’re right on track

So today I spilled my water
I could see I had something to offer
In the middle of the watery mess
I could see I was blessed

So today I spilled my water
I could see I had something to offer
In the middle of the watery mess
I could see I was blessed
