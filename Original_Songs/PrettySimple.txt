Title: Pretty Simple | Writer: Daphne Link

If I'm having tea, earl grey
I want to offer you some, no delay
If you struggle to buy food
Let me give you some, brighten your mood

When will we be as one
Stop judging what someone's done
In my mind we can be more than civil
In my mind it's pretty simple

If you're homeless in a bus station
You're also important in this nation
It might not seem like it where you stand
But I'm praying it's part of God's plan

When will we be as one
Stop judging what someone's done
In my mind we can be more than civil
In my mind it's pretty simple

When will we be as one
Stop judging what someone's done
In my mind we can be more than civil
In my mind it's pretty simple
