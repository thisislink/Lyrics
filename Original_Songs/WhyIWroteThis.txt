Title: Why I Wrote This | Writer: Daphne Link

I went to the beach to think
Thoughts of you make my heart sink
I wrote ‘I love you’ in the sand
Can’t forget how I held your hand

When I look out on the shore
You’re the one I’m looking for
It’s always you I miss
That’s why I wrote this

I took a walk on the pier
I imagined you were here
I smiled as the waves rushed in
A memory of you left me frozen

When I look out on the shore
You’re the one I’m looking for
It’s always you I miss
That’s why I wrote this

When I look out on the shore
You’re the one I’m looking for
It’s always you I miss
That’s why I wrote this
