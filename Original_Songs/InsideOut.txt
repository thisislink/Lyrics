Title: Inside Out | Writer: Daphne Link

I love you from the inside out
What real love should be about
Not from the outside in
What matters comes from within

You tell me you love math more than art
I can see the beauty in a pie chart
You hate to travel and that's okay
I even love how you hate a horse's neigh

I love you from the inside out
What real love should be about
Not from the outside in
What matters comes from within

You love rock bands like The 1975
I love how they make you feel alive
I love them too but if I didn't
It wouldn't matter, I'd still be smitten

I love you from the inside out
What real love should be about
Not from the outside in
What matters comes from within

I love you from the inside out
What real love should be about
Not from the outside in
What matters comes from within

I love you from the inside out
What real love should be about
Not from the outside in
What matters comes from within
