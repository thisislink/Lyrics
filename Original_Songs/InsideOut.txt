Title: Inside Out | Writer: Daphne Link

I love you from the inside out
What real love should be about
Not from the outside in
What matters comes from within

Tell me how you love math more than art
I can see the beauty in a pie chart
You hate to travel and that's okay
I even love how you hate a horse's neigh

I love you from the inside out
What real love should be about
Not from the outside in
What matters comes from within
