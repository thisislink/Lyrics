Title: Lost In A Book | Writer: Daphne Link

A book and a place to sit
This is my travel kit
A book can take me anywhere
There's no need for a spare

I love to get lost in a book
With each word I read, I'm shook
It could be fact or fiction
Good stories are my addiction

A book can teach me skills
Or it can give me thrills
It can show me suspense one minute
Or love the next, there's no limit

I love to get lost in a book
With each word I read, I'm shook
It could be fact or fiction
Good stories are my addiction

I love to get lost in a book
With each word I read, I'm shook
It could be fact or fiction
Good stories are my addiction
