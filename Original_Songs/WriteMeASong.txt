Title: Write Me A Song
Writer: Daphne Link

I just want you to write me a song
So I can play it all night long
In it talk about your favorite color
And how you love the summer

I just want you to write me a song
Write me a song
Write me a song
Write me a song

Throw in a line about house decor
And living room furniture you adore 
Add a line about being a kid
Back when you had no fear and never quit

I just want you to write me a song
So I can play it all night long
In it talk about your favorite color
And how you love the summer

I just want you to write me a song
Write me a song
Write me a song
Write me a song

Use your words to map how you feel
I wanna know every word you said is real
I wanna be picked up by your words
At the same time feel down to earth

I just want you to write me a song
So I can play it all night long
In it talk about your favorite color
And how you love the summer

I just want you to write me a song
Write me a song
Write me a song
Write me a song
