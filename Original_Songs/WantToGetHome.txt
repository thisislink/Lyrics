Title: Want To Get Home | Writer: Daphne Link

Stopped at a light with tracks
The arms come down, this drags
Sitting here to gain more patience
And this is building the foundation

I just want to get home
Had a long day, need to be alone
My path was clear until this
Maybe later I’ll see this as bliss

Now the train’s slowing down
Please don’t stop, or I’m gonna frown
People are speeding off really mad
No waiting, taking a different path

I just want to get home
Had a long day, need to be alone
My path was clear until this
Maybe later I’ll see this as bliss

The train complexly stopped
Never seen this before, I’m jaw dropped
Now I’m thinking where did this get me
Guess I wrote a song at the tracks, nothing fancy

I just want to get home
Had a long day, need to be alone
My path was clear until this
Maybe later I’ll see this as bliss
