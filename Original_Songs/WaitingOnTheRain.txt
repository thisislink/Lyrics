Title: Waiting On The Rain | Writer: Daphne Link

Waiting on the rain
To wash away the pain
Waiting on the rain
So I can start again

Some people wait for the sun
Like it'll answer their problems
But you know better
Rainbows only come after bad weather

Waiting on the rain
To wash away the pain
Waiting on the rain
So I can start again
