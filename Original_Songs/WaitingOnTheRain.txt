Title: Waiting On The Rain | Writer: Daphne Link

You're waiting on the rain
To wash away the pain
You're waiting on the rain
So you can start again

Some people wait for the sun
Like it'll answer their problems
But you know better
Rainbows only come after bad weather

You're waiting on the rain
To wash away the pain
You're waiting on the rain
So you can start again

In notebooks 
You keep your hopes and fears
The drought is felt 
In your words through the years

You're waiting on the rain
To wash away the pain
You're waiting on the rain
So you can start again

You're waiting on the rain
So you can start again
