Title: I'll Go | Writer: Daphne Link

In six months,
you said you're leaving
And it's not my fault, 
you have your reasons

You'd prefer I come with you
But you said,
you don't want to ask me to
I looked at you and said
Two words and kissed your head

I'll go
If you're leaving I'll follow
It's you'll all always choose
There's nothing here for me to lose
So, I'll go

The day has come,
you said I can change my mind
I said there's no need, I feel fine

You said this could change my life
I said I'm counting on it,
As I grabbed your hand by your side

I'll go
If you're leaving I'll follow
It's you'll all always choose
There's nothing here for me to lose
So, I'll go

If you're leaving I'll follow
It's you'll all always choose
There's nothing here for me to lose
So, I'll go
I'll go
