Title: I'll Go | Writer: Daphne Link

In six months,
you said you're leaving
And it's not my fault, 
you have your reasons

You'd prefer I come with you
But you said,
you don't want to ask me to
I looked at you and said
Two words and kissed your head

I'll go
If you're leaving I'll follow
It's you'll all always choose
There's nothing here for me to lose
So, I'll go
