Title: 100 | Writer: Daphne Link

Keep it 100 is a phrase we see
By people judge who you try to be
Others like to say ride or die
So you end up drowning, afraid to fly

People's opinions will try to break you
So you gotta do more than make do
Take the opinions and set 'em on fire
Love who you are and you'll be inspired

100 percent is perfect in school
Anything less and you feel like a fool
They don't tell you other ways to succeed
That there's more to life than
papers you didn't proofread

People's opinions will try to break you
So you gotta do more than make do
Take the opinions and set 'em on fire
Love who you are and you'll be inspired

Love who you are and you'll be inspired
Love who you are and you'll be inspired
