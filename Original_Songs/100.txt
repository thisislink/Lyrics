Title: 100 | Writer: Daphne Link

Keep it 100 is a phrase we see
But people judge who you try to be
Others like to say ride or die
So you end up drowning, afraid to fly

People's opinions will try to break you
So you gotta do more than make do
Take the opinions and set 'em on fire
Love who you are and you'll be inspired
