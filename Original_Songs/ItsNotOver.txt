Title: It’s Not Over | Writer: Daphne Link

It’s not over
It’s not over
I’m only getting closer
It’s not over

Sometimes you have a bad day
Things so bad you don’t think to pray
Wondering if there really is karma
Life so dramatic you need a movie saga

It’s not the end, you’re still breathing
It’s not the end, so keep thinking

It’s not over
It’s not over
I’m only getting closer
It’s not over

Thought you had it figured out by now
You said you’d never take another vow
But second marriage is about to end
Lesson learned, now you lost your best friend

It’s not the end, you’re still breathing
It’s not the end, so keep thinking

It’s not over
It’s not over
I’m only getting closer
It’s not over
