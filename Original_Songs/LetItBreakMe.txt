Title: Let It Break Me | Writer: Daphne Link

My heart's been broken a time or two
I was lost and didn't know what to do
Creating walls was all I knew
Until one day I had a breakthrough

It was something I couldn't explain
I finally wanted to feel the pain

Now I'm gonna let it break me
I wanna feel it shake me
No longer gonna avoid love
I'm letting it fill what I'm afraid of

My heart's been broken a time or two
I was lost and didn't know what to do
Creating walls was all I knew
Until one day I had a breakthrough

It was something I couldn't explain
I finally wanted to feel the pain

Now I'm gonna let it break me
I wanna feel it shake me
No longer gonna avoid love
I'm letting it fill what I'm afraid of

No longer gonna avoid love
I'm letting it fill what I'm afraid of

No longer gonna avoid love
I'm letting it fill what I'm afraid of
