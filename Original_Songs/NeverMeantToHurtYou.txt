Title: Never Meant To Hurt You | Writer: Daphne Link

Our twenties were like quicksand
We lived life without a plan
Now I'm shocked about the things we did
Lessons learned from the life we lived

I didn't know how to love
But you were all I could think of
I never meant to hurt you
It was the last thing I wanted to do

I remember the days we fought
I always took a cheap shot
Holding mistakes over your head
I only knew how to see red

I didn't know how to love
But you were all I could think of
I never meant to hurt you
It was the last thing I wanted to do

I remember I never listened
On purpose I was twisted

I didn't know how to love
But you were all I could think of
I never meant to hurt you
It was the last thing I wanted to do
