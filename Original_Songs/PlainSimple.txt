You could say I'm tired of losing
It's starting to be amusing
This life is just a riddle
Is it ever plain simple?

I booked an early plane
Then it was 3 hours delayed
Hit the casino to play roulette
Lost too much money I was upset

You could say I'm tired of losing
It's starting to be amusing
Is life always a riddle
Is it ever plain simple?
