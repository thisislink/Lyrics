Title: Plain Simple
Writer: Daphne Link

You could say I'm tired of losing
It's starting to be amusing
Is life always a riddle
Is it ever plain simple?

I booked an early plane
Then it was 3 hours delayed
Hit the casino to play roulette
Lost too much money I was upset

You could say I'm tired of losing
It's starting to be amusing
Is life always a riddle
Is it ever plain simple?

Ripped my jeans as I took a seat
Someone took a picture and made a tweet
Hit a pot hole on the way home
Need a new tire now it's blown

You could say I'm tired of losing
It's starting to be amusing
Is life always a riddle
Is it ever plain simple?

You could say I'm tired of losing
It's starting to be amusing
Is life always a riddle
Is it ever plain simple?

You could say I'm tired of losing
It's starting to be amusing
Is life always a riddle
Is it ever plain simple?
