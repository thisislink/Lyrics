Title: Afraid To Dream | Writer: Daphne Link

You say you wanna be happy
Step one, stop feeling crappy
And don't be afraid to dream
You know it's what you need

You're told school is the way
Keep your eyes on graduation day
Their dreams for you aren't yours
You want more than office doors

You say you wanna be happy
Step one, stop feeling crappy
And don't be afraid to dream
You know it's what you need
