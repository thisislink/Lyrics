Title: Where Are You Now | Writer: Daphne Link

You crossed my mind today
I know it's almost your birthday
I don't really think that's why
It's because we never said bye

Our memories were all good
But then we hit adulthood
Conversations slowly faded
Much like dreams we painted

My hope is one day we'll meet again
You'll talk about all the places you've been
But I don't know when, where, or how
So I'm here wondering where are you now
