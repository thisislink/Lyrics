Title: Where Are You Now | Writer: Daphne Link

You crossed my mind today
I know it's almost your birthday
I don't really think that's why
It's because we never said bye

Our memories were all good
But then we hit adulthood
Conversations slowly faded
Much like dreams we painted

My hope is we'll meet again
You talk about the places you've been
I don't know where or how
So I'm here wondering where are you now
