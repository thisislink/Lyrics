Title: With Patience
Writer: Daphne Link

Attention can be an addictive drug
But this is no time to be smug
Instead it's time to inspire
Use these words to start a fire

So I make sure I have no expectations
Just determination with patience
Cause I know life's like spaghetti
But I know one day there'll be confetti

In the comments when there's a butcher
Cutting people down word killer
They don't know the jokes on them
They have no power to condemn

So I make sure I have no expectations
Just determination with patience
Cause I know life's like spaghetti
But I know one day there'll be confetti
