Title: Moment Of Truth
Writer: Daphne Link

When we met we spoke in riddles
Before we knew it nothing was simple
Was that sweet kiss just a dream?
Reality, fantasy either way I wanna scream

This is the moment of truth
Will we hit a homerun babe ruth?
Do we keep our cards close to our chest?
Words unspoken, love unconfessed

Whatever this is, it's no simple equation
My feelings plus yours is a vulnerable narration
Let's promise if this ends we don't forget
There's no winner, no checkmate chess set

This is the moment of truth
Will we hit a homerun babe ruth?
Do we keep our cards close to our chest?
Words unspoken, love unconfessed

(Instrumental)

When we met we spoke in riddles
Before we knew it nothing was simple
Was that sweet kiss just a dream?
Reality, fantasy either way I wanna scream
