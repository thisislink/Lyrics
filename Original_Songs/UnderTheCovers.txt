Title: Under the Covers | Writer: Daphne Link

Every morning I experience evil
It's my alarm clock, ruining peaceful
I hate it's always on the attack
Since I nicely turn it off with a tap

I'm way too cozy, I said
Can I just go to back to bed?

Just wanna get under the covers
Where it's warm like melted butter
Just wanna get under the covers
Go to sleep and dream great wonders

My day job has me really feening
I'm ready for some deep sleepin'
So when I get home it's no game
Catching some z's is my aim

I'm way too cozy, I said
Can I just go to back to bed?

Just wanna get under the covers
Where it's warm like melted butter
Just wanna get under the covers
Go to sleep and dream great wonders

Just wanna get under the covers
Where it's warm like melted butter
Just wanna get under the covers
Go to sleep and dream great wonders
