Title: When I Breathe | Writer: Daphne Link

You've been sick for a couple days
But some think it's more than a phase
They say you've lost your mind
You know its come and gone a few times

So, you walk away to take a rest
More like a breath suppressed

The muscle aches that shake my bones
Cause more than audible groans
When I breathe in, the pain is deep
But the exhale is a sweet release

You're starting to have more energy
But some think you're in a reverie
They think you've lost touch with reality
They don't know,
You're more in touch than they'll ever be

So, you walk away to take a rest
More like a breath suppressed

The muscle aches that shake my bones
Cause more than audible groans
When I breathe in, the pain is deep
But the exhale is a sweet release

The muscle aches that shake my bones

The muscle aches that shake my bones
Cause more than audible groans
When I breathe in, the pain is deep
But the exhale is a sweet release
