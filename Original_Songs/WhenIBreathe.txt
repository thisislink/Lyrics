Title: When I Breathe | Writer: Daphne Link


You've been sick for a couple days
But some think it's more than a phase
They say you've lost your mind
You know its come and gone a few times

You walk away to take a rest
More like a breath suppressed

The muscle aches that shake my bones
Cause more than audible groans
When I breathe in, the pain is deep
But the exhale is a sweet release
