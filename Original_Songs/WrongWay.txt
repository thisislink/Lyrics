Title: Wrong Way | Writer: Daphne Link

I had a plan laid out before me
Just follow it like 1, 2, 3
But when a mistake was made
The plan blew up like a grenade

Sometimes you have to disobey
To see the wrong way is the right way
No one knows for sure
If their answer is the cure

Thinking outside the box is inspiring
Making new rules is exciting
So when I didnâ€™t know what to do
I embraced a new plan without a clue

Sometimes you have to disobey
To see the wrong way is the right way
No one knows for sure
If their answer is the cure
