Title: Start Again | Writer: Daphne Link

Early in life we learn life's not fair
It's always unfair if you're unprepared
You gotta focus on what you want
Go all in, give no second thought

And if you ever think it's over
Go jump in a Land Rover
Go against the grain
And be ready to start again

You went and tried something new
You felt good, had a breakthrough
Then someone said something hurtful
Brush it off, it's one hurdle

And if you ever think it's over
Go jump in a Land Rover
Go against the grain
And be ready to start again

The greatness about starting over
You're one step closer
The greatness about starting again
You're one loss closer to a win

And if you ever think it's over
Go jump in a Land Rover
Go against the grain
And be ready to start again

And if you ever think it's over
Go jump in a Land Rover
Go against the grain
And be ready to start again
