Title: Start Again | Writer: Daphne Link

Early in life we learn life's not fair
It's always unfair if you're unprepared
You gotta focus on what you want
Go all in, give no second thought

And if you ever think it's over
Go jump in a Land Rover
Go against the grain
And be ready to start again

You went and tried something new
You felt good, had a breakthrough
