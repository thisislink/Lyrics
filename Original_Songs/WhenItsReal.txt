Title: When It’s Real | Title: Daphne Link

You can be happy or sad
Either way you’re on the right path
The tears will well up out of nothing
When it’s real you feel something

You could be watching a movie
You suddenly start crying profusely
You’d rather no one notice
You wipe your eyes and try to focus

You can be happy or sad
Either way you’re on the right path
The tears will well up out of nothing
When it’s real you feel something

You can be moved so deeply
A beautiful moment passes briefly
So remember it when it’s gone
In moments you feel withdrawn

You can be happy or sad
Either way you’re on the right path
The tears will well up out of nothing
When it’s real you feel something

When it’s real you feel something
When it’s real you feel something
When it’s real you feel something
