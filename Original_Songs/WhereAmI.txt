Title: Where Am I? | Writer: Daphne Link

I took a couple detours
Still, some days I'm so sure
I've got it all figured out
I know what life's all about

Then I'll stare at the blue sky
Thinking to myself where am I?
I think I'm where I'm supposed to be
Struggling to see the plan for me

Now it's not all the time
I doubt I'm fulfilling my why
It's that I realize it's hard work
Everyday grinding without the perks

Then I'll stare at the blue sky
Thinking to myself where am I?
I think I'm where I'm supposed to be
Struggling to see the plan for me

Seeds of doubt try to haunt me
But peace and patience live in me
Seeds of doubt try to haunt me
But peace and patience live in me

(Instrumental)

Then I'll stare at the blue sky
Thinking to myself where am I?
I think I'm where I'm supposed to be
Struggling to see the plan for me
