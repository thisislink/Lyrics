Title: If I'm The One | Writer: Daphne Link

Another month passes by
And you still wonder why
You're not with love of your life
You have no idea I'm your future wife

You'll know if I'm the one
You'll see how I'm a midnight sun
And why the others never worked out
This is a love story without a doubt

All your friends said,
"The last one was perfect"
To you, something never clicked
You still don't know what it is
You have no idea I'm what you miss

You'll know if I'm the one
You'll see how I'm a midnight sun
And why the others never worked out
This is a love story without a doubt

This is a love story without doubt
Yeah, this is a love story
This is a love story without a doubt

You'll know if I'm the one
You'll see how I'm a midnight sun
And why the others never worked out
This is a love story without a doubt

You'll know if I'm the one
