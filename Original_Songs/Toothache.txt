Title: Toothache | Writer: Daphne Link

Positivity in every situation
Your vibes could heal a nation
If you were stuck in a dungeon
You wouldn't feel you were being punished

You're so sweet you give me a toothache
So sweet, no syrup with my pancakes
But your attitude is what the world needs
I'm taking notes from your lead
You're so sweet you give me a toothache

(Instrumental)

You're so sweet you give me a toothache
So sweet, no syrup with my pancakes
But your attitude is what the world needs
I'm taking notes from your lead

You're so sweet you give me a toothache
You're so sweet you give me a toothache
You're so sweet you give me a toothache
You're so sweet you give me a toothache
You're so sweet you give me a toothache
