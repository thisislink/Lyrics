Title: Classic
Writer: Daphne Link

Everyday she wakes up
Her first thought she’s not good enough
She puts on makeup to cover the lines
She doesn’t see she’s like a fine wine

She don’t see she’s classic
Like a 1970 Camaro, she’s magic
And I honestly don’t know what that means
But she’s those black & white movie love scenes
Yeah she’s classic

As she sits in traffic on the way to work 
The car next to her is her boss, the jerk
Her boss is one reason she feels small
Her boss, an ex, is why she keeps up a wall

She don’t see she’s classic
Like a 1970 Camaro, she’s magic
And I honestly don’t know what that means
But she’s those black & white movie love scenes
Yeah she’s classic

There was a time she used to dream
A time before she lost her self esteem
There was a time she used to think
“I’m really special” and gave herself a wink

But now she don’t see she’s classic
Like a 1970 Camaro, she’s magic
And I honestly don’t know what that means
But she’s those black & white movie love scenes
Yeah she’s classic

She don’t see she’s classic
Like a 1970 Camaro, she’s magic
And I honestly don’t know what that means
But she’s those black & white movie love scenes
Yeah she’s classic
