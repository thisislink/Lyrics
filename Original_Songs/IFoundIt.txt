Title: I Found It
Writer: Daphne Link

I thought I was too young, had no experience
It was just the world being a negative influence
Living in America I have so many choices
Afraid of making the wrong one, drug overdoses

‘Cause there was no way I was gonna stop
Good thing because I came out on top
There was no way I was gonna quit
Good thing because I found it

I thought I had to amount to something
That I should be someone less disgusting
Then came the day I just stopped
I learned to let go and just sobbed

‘Cause there was no way I was gonna stop
Good thing because I came out on top
There was no way I was gonna quit
Good thing because I found it
