Title: Like Today | Writer: Daphne Link

The day started like any other
But ended like a perfect summer
Windows down in a car ride
After a day at the beachside

I dream this happens all the time 
That's one goal this lifetime
But for now, today was a good day
I love days like today

Laid under the sun in the sand
With a digital book in hand
Had a pineapple smoothie with boba
Owner from my hometown, Visalia persona

I dream this happens all the time 
That's one goal this lifetime
But for now, today was a good day
I love days like today

The day started like any other
But ended like a perfect summer
Windows down in a car ride
After a day at the beachside

I dream this happens all the time 
That's one goal this lifetime
But for now, today was a good day
I love days like today

I love days like today
I love days like today
I love days like today
I love days like today
