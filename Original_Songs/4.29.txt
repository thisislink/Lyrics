Our conversations flow like a river
I’m drunk on the word liquor
You know how to draw me into you 
Something not very many can do

We’re talking and I see the sign
Three little digits say 4.29
I mean, I saw it before this
But now it’s something I can’t dismiss

The detective in me sees you
So you let me uncover what others abuse
Nothing about you is ordinary 
You make sure I see you’re a visionary

We’re talking and I see the sign
Three little digits say 4.29
I mean, I saw it before this
But now it’s something I can’t dismiss

The One from above
Filled me with love
To give to you completely
Like the wind blows free and easy 
The One from above
Filled me with love
To give to you completely
Like the wind blows free and easy 

We’re talking and I see the sign
Three little digits say 4.29
I mean, I saw it before this
But now it’s something I can’t dismiss
