Title: Memory | Writer: Daphne Link

Something about a memory
It hits me intensely
This amazing part of my mind
Likes to take me back in time

I could be watching a movie
Even something really goofy
A scene will touch my heart
For a moment I fall apart

Something about a memory
It hits me intensely
This amazing part of my mind
Likes to take me back in time

When I'm in the car, radio on
A song hits me and then I'm gone
Or I'm having a talk with a friend
Something they say takes me back again

Something about a memory
It hits me intensely
This amazing part of my mind
Likes to take me back in time

Memory, Memory
Yeah, memory, memory
Memory, memory
Something about a memory

Memory, Memory
Yeah, memory, memory
Memory, memory
Something about a memory

Something about a memory
It hits me intensely
This amazing part of my mind
Likes to take me back in time

Yeah, this amazing part of my mind
Likes to take me back in time
