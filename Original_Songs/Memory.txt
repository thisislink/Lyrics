Title: Memory | Writer: Daphne Link

Something about a memory
It hits me intensely
This amazing part of my mind
Likes to take me back in time

I could be watching a movie
Even something really goofy
A scene will touch my heart
For a moment I fall apart

Something about a memory
It hits me intensely
This amazing part of my mind
Likes to take me back in time
