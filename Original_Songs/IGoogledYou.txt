Title: I Googled You | Writer: Daphne Link

I knew your first name and workplace
A couple searches I had your birthplace
Found you on Instagram and Twitter
Your favorite time of year is winter

You don't know I Googled you
To know what I was getting into
Reversed imaged searched your photos
Don't wanna be on Catfish episodes

I won't say a word when we meet
About that song in your last tweet
I'll ask questions, be unsuspecting
Be respectful, yet keep you guessing

You don't know I Googled you
To know what I was getting into
Reversed imaged searched your photos
Don't wanna be on Catfish episodes
