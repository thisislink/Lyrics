Title: I Googled You | Writer: Daphne Link

I knew your first name and workplace
A couple searches I had your birthplace
Found you on Instagram and Twitter
Your favorite time of year is winter

I admit it, I Googled you
To know what I was getting into
Reversed imaged searched your photos
Don't wanna be on Catfish episodes
