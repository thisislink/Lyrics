Title: I.M.P.R.O.V.E.
Writer: Daphne Link

I never liked the saying
You should reach for the stars
For me it's too limiting
To seek what's in front of the visible doors

I don't have dreams to play in big stadiums
The crowd doesn't need to love me

I.M.P.R.O.V.E.
On that next level's where I'm gonna be
I'm in no rush, I placed bets on me
My hand's a royal flush I'm playing slowly

Making people smile is my mission
I'm trying to be your resident music physician
So when the beat starts a fire in your heart
Recognize you too are a work of art

You don't need dreams to play in big stadiums
The crowd doesn't need to love you

I.M.P.R.O.V.E.
On that next level's where you're gonna be
Be in no rush, your bets on you are key
Your hand's a royal flush so play slowly

I.M.P.R.O.V.E.
On that next level's where I'm gonna be
I'm in no rush, I placed bets on me
My hand's a royal flush I'm playing slowly
