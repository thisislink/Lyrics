Title: What Can I Be | Writer: Daphne Link

What do you wanna be when you grow up?
People want you to decide so young
Do you have fun or do what matters?
The wrong decision can be a disaster

But if I don't try
How will I figure out life?
So what can I be?
Anything that makes me happy

What do you wanna be when you grow up?
People want you to decide so young
Do you have fun or do what matters?
The wrong decision can be a disaster

But if I don't try
How will I figure out life?
So what can I be?
Anything that makes me happy

Anything that makes me happy
Anything that makes me happy
Anything that makes me happy
Anything that makes me happy
