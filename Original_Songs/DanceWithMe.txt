Title: Dance With Me | Writer: Daphne Link

You're not usually this quiet
You've said you hate when it's silent
You're afraid of the unknown
But you don't have to go it alone

I want you to dance with me
Forget everything and be carefree
We can dance slow or fast
Let's just make this moment last
I want you to dance with me
Dance with me

I don't mind you this quiet
I'm at ease with you, even when it's silent
I'm also afraid of the unknown
But I don't have to go it alone

I want you to dance with me
Forget everything and be carefree
We can dance slow or fast
Let's just make this moment last
I want you to dance with me
Dance with me

(Instrumental)

I want you to dance with me
Forget everything and be carefree
We can dance slow or fast
Let's just make this moment last
I want you to dance with me
Dance with me
