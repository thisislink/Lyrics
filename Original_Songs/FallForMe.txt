Title: Fall For Me
Writer: Daphne Link

We're on our way to becoming better
So when we meet we're ready to be lovers
We won't have to come to a screeching halt
We'll keep our secrets safe in a vault

So if the door's locked I'll give you the key
So you can open it and fall for me
We'll come together individually complete
So our love will never be bittersweet

Together we'll glorify our Savior
We'll keep him first, never later
Even when we're on top of the mountain
We'll stay humble always grounded

So if the door's locked I'll give you the key
So you can open it and fall for me
We'll come together individually complete
So our love will never be bittersweet

For now I don't know what's in store
But I'm still dancing on the dance floor
I'm still dancing on the dance floor

So if the door's locked I'll give you the key
So you can open it and fall for me
We'll come together individually complete
So our love will never be bittersweet
