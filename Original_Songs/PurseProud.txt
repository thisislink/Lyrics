Title: Purse Proud | Writer: Daphne Link

As a kid no one liked you
So you paid them to be your crew
How people treated you made you mad
If only you saw your attitude was bad 

Will you ever stop being purse proud?
Using your wealth to bring a crowd
That’s not how you make a friend
They’re gone as fast as the next trend

As you got older, nothing got better
No one could love your bad temper
So you did what you knew best
Buying things that left you depressed

Will you ever stop being purse proud?
Using your wealth to bring a crowd
That’s not how you make a friend
They’re gone as fast as the next trend

Everyday you’re left unfulfilled
Being purse proud is losing its thrill 

Will you ever stop being purse proud?
Using your wealth to bring a crowd
That’s not how you make a friend
They’re gone as fast as the next trend
