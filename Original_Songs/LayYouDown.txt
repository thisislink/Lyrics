Title: Lay Her Down | Writer: Daphne Link

She's enters the room
She's like a flower in bloom
You can't help but stare
There's no one to compare

And when she's ready
Her breath's a little unsteady
She'll make that sound
Then you'll know to lay her down

She says she likes the guitar
You lightly strum her north star
And when you kiss her neck
She sounds like a baby T-Rex
