Title: 30 Minutes | Writer: Daphne Link

It seems like there’s not enough time
You wake up one day passed your prime
Days turn into hours and minutes to seconds
Is there enough time to become a legend?

For me, I wrote this song I don’t like
While riding a stationary bike
I even bought some concert tickets
What can you do in 30 minutes? 

On long days you’re tired and need a nap
To stay alert and dodge mind traps
But the times passes in the blink of an eye
Will you do enough before you die?

For me, I wrote this song I don’t like
While riding a stationary bike
I even bought some concert tickets
What can you do in 30 minutes? 

What can you do in 30 minutes? 
What can you do in 30 minutes? 
What can you do in 30 minutes? 
What can you do in 30 minutes?
