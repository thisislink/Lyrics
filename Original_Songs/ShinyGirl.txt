Title: Shiny Girl | Writer: Daphne Link

Something about her, she has charm
Makes you wanna tattoo her name on your arm
Go broke buying roses and chocolate
She'll make sure there's no money in your wallet

She can't be traced, watch her closely
No cash, she pays with credit only
She's smart and attracts large crowds
If you're with her, you'll feel proud

(Instrumental)

Shiny girl, yeah
Shi-shi-ny girl
Shiny girl, yeah
Shi-shi-ny girl
Shiny girl, yeah
Shi-shi-ny girl
Shiny girl, yeah
Shi-shi-ny girl

She needs all your attention
So you make her your obsession
But then she gets bored
You learn a life lesson

(Instrumental)

Everything about her is flashy
She can't be mistaken for trashy
She likes to be treated like a queen
Oddly she also likes her Uber limousine's 

She can't be traced, watch her closely
No cash, she pays with credit only
She's smart and attracts large crowds
If you're with her, you'll feel proud

(Instrumental)

Shiny girl, yeah
Shi-shi-ny girl
Shiny girl, yeah
Shi-shi-ny girl
Shiny girl, yeah
Shi-shi-ny girl
Shiny girl, yeah
Shi-shi-ny girl

She can't be traced, watch her closely
No cash, she pays with credit only
She's smart and attracts large crowds
If you're with her, you'll feel proud

(Instrumental)

Shiny girl, yeah
Shi-shi-ny girl
Shiny girl, yeah
Shi-shi-ny girl
Shiny girl, yeah
Shi-shi-ny girl
Shiny girl, yeah
Shi-shi-ny girl
