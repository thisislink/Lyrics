Title: Shiny Girl | Writer: Daphne Link

tattoo her name on your arm
spend all the money in your wallet
No cash, she pays with credit only
To date her, you better have money

She needs all your attention
She's the entire garden
Fruits, vegetables, expensive treatments
Nothing about her is a bargain
