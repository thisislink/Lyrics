Title: Shiny Girl | Writer: Daphne Link

Something about her, she has charm
Makes you wanna tattoo her name on your arm
Go broke buying roses and chocolate
She'll make sure there's no money in your wallet

She can't be traced, watch her closely
No cash, she pays with credit only
She's smart and attracts a crowd
If you're with her, you'll feel proud

Shiny girl, yeah
Shi-shi-ny girl
Shiny girl, yeah
Shi-shi-ny girl
Shiny girl, yeah
Shi-shi-ny girl

By tomorrow you'll be feeling lonely



To date her, you better have money

She needs all your attention
She's the entire garden
Fruits, vegetables, expensive treatments
Nothing about her is a bargain
