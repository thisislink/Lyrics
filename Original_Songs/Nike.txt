Title: Nike | Writer: Daphne Link

I used to ball, wore the swoosh logo
But had no drive to go pro, oh no
Found it was music I always loved
Almost as much as the One up above

I finally found my thing
So, now I sing

I want to just do it like Nike
And Professor X, mess with your psyche
So if I'm ever big in this business
Remember I put in work and I was fearless

Like Nike, wanna do it like Nike
Like Nike, wanna do it like Nike
Like Nike, just wanna do it like Nike
Like Nike, I'ma do it like Nike

Wrote my first song in 7th grade
For a science project, got an A
I shoulda known then what I had to do
But for years sports was my pursuit

I finally found my thing
So, now I sing

I want to just do it like Nike
And Professor X, mess with your psyche
So if I'm ever big in this business
Remember I put in work and I was fearless

Like Nike, wanna do it like Nike
Like Nike, wanna do it like Nike
Like Nike, just wanna do it like Nike
Like Nike, I'ma do it like Nike
