Title: Nike | Writer: Daphne Link

I used to ball, wore the swoosh logo
But I had no drive to go pro, oh no
I found it was music that I always loved
Almost as much as the One up above

I found my thing
So, now I sing

I want to just do it like Nike
Like Professor X, and mess with your psyche
So if I'm ever big in this business
Remember I put in work and I was fearless

Like Nike, wanna do it like Nike
Like Nike, wanna do it like Nike
Like Nike, just do it like Nike
Like Nike, I'ma do it like Nike
