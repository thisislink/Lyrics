Title: This Is The End | Writer: Daphne Link

Is this the end?
How can it be 
When you just started again?

Did you reach the point of no return?
How could you
When in life you're meant to learn?

Your mind will trick you
When your heart is feeling blue
The push and pull of this is the end
How much more energy will you expend?

You'll see what went wrong
By retracing your steps
Was it an open door or cobwebs?

When you find the answer
Be sure to make a note
For the next time
You're in a sinking boat

Your mind will trick you
When your heart is feeling blue
The push and pull of this is the end
How much more energy will you expend?
