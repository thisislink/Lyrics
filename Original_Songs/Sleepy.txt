Title: Sleepy
Writer: Daphne Link

Right now I'm sleepy
Trying to stay awake 
My eyes get weepy
And all throughout the day
In my bed's where I wanna lay
And take a ride on the sleep train

Not looking forward to daybreak
Getting out of bed, I don't wanna partake
Yeah sometimes cool things happen in the day
But nothing as cool as sleeping, it's great
