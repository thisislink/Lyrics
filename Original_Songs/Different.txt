Title: Different
Writer: Daphne Link

When I need your guidance
Your response is never silence
You're the definition of different
Nothing short of magnificent

I was unsure about my future
You entered life, became my tutor
When I was at the end of my rope
You came and gave me hope

When I need your guidance
Your response is never silence
You're the definition of different
Nothing short of magnificent

You showed me through my strife
I was worthy of eternal life
You showed me through my strife
I was worthy of eternal life

When I need your guidance
Your response is never silence
You're the definition of different
Nothing short of magnificent
