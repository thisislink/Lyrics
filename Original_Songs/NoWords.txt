Title: No Words | Writer: Daphne Link

What do you do
When you have no clue
What do you say
When the words slip away

You can say nothing
It's still something
In the silence of the birds
It's best to lead with no words

When filled with doubt
Where do you hide out
What do you do
When all eyes are on you

You can say nothing
It's still something
In the silence of the birds
It's best to lead with no words

If you feel weak
By the pressure to speak
Succumb to the sound
Of a silent playground

You can say nothing
It's still something
In the silence of the birds
It's best to lead with no words
