Title: Remote Control
Writer: Daphne Link

I come home and you want my attention
I walk away from you and give no affection
You start a convo about your tattoos
And I ignore you like yesterday's news

As soon as the arguing begins, I'm wishing
Everything said and done will be forgiven
I know what I say and do makes you explode
But if you only knew I'm your remote control

I know something's wrong with me
Please don't leave, I want you to see
I can do better and touch your soul
Please don't leave, I'm your remote control

As soon as the arguing begins, I'm wishing
Everything said and done will be forgiven
I know what I say and do makes you explode
But if you only knew I'm your remote control

The way I stampede on your feelings
How I hurt you is just as bad as cheating

As soon as the arguing begins, I'm wishing
Everything said and done will be forgiven
I know what I say and do makes you explode
But if you only knew I'm your remote control
