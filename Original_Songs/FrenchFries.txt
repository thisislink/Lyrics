Title: French Fries | Writer: Daphne Link

French fries
Don't you like french fries?
I eat so many french fries
They might be my demise

I just wanna eat french fries 
Each bite is like I won a prize
Favs are crinkle cut, tots or curly
I'll dip 'em in a dairy-free McFlurry

I could each french fries every meal
Couldn't you? Let's be real
Air fried with a little salt
This is my go to meal, default

I just wanna eat french fries 
Each bite is like I won a prize
Favs are crinkle cut, tots or curly
I'll dip 'em in a dairy-free McFlurry

I just wanna eat french fries
French fries, french fries
I just wanna eat french fries

I just wanna eat french fries 
Each bite is like I won a prize
Favs are crinkle cut, tots or curly
I'll dip 'em in a dairy-free McFlurry
