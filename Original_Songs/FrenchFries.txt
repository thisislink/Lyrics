Title: French Fries | Writer: Daphne Link

French fries
Don't you like French fries?
I eat so many French fries
They might be my demise

I just wanna eat French fries 
Each bite is like I won a prize
Favs are crinkle cut, tots or curly
I'll dip 'em in a dairy-free McFlurry

I could eat French fries every meal
Couldn't you? Let's be real
Air fried with a little salt
This is my go to meal, default

I just wanna eat French fries 
Each bite is like I won a prize
Favs are crinkle cut, tots or curly
I'll dip 'em in a dairy-free McFlurry

I just wanna eat French fries
French fries, French fries
I just wanna eat French fries

I just wanna eat French fries 
Each bite is like I won a prize
Favs are crinkle cut, tots or curly
I'll dip 'em in a dairy-free McFlurry
