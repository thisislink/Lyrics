Title: Pure | Writer: Daphne Link

In the beginning
The first date feels like winning
Anticipation of the first kiss
Wishing every moment was like this

This is so pure
I never want the cure
Let's stay this way
Bypass heartbreak highway

Things change as time goes by
It's a fact you try to deny
Wonderin' where did that spark go?
Think back before the plateau

This is so pure
I never want the cure
Let's stay this way
Bypass heartbreak highway

We have to make a shift
The purity of love is a gift
We have to make a shift
The purity of love is a gift
We have to make a shift
The purity of love is a gift
We have to make a shift
The purity of love is a gift

The purity of love is

This is so pure
I never want the cure
Let's stay this way
Bypass heartbreak highway
