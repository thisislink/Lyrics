Title: Rest of My Life
Writer: Daphne Link

I just want you to know
With all you've done for me 
I can't let go
And these are my words to say
I love you and 
I wouldn't have it any other way

For the rest of my life
You will be my guide
Push me forward when I'm not ready
Your hands will keep me steady

For the rest of my life
You will be my guide
Push me forward when I'm not ready
Your hands will keep me steady
