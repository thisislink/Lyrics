Title: Rest of My Life
Writer: Daphne Link

I just want You to know
With all You've done for me 
I can't You let go
And these are my words to say
I love You and 
I wouldn't have it any other way

For the rest of my life
You will be my guide
Push me forward when I'm not ready
Your hands will keep me steady

For the rest of my life
You will be my guide
Push me forward when I'm not ready
Your hands will keep me steady

I'm out here, I'm looking for answers
Tryin' to find what really matters
You've shown me what I need to see
Life's about love, that's the key

Yeah I know what I'm doing is not the norm
This is what happens when you've been reborn
This is what happens when you're awake
When you've been given a new road to take

For the rest of my life
You will be my guide
Push me forward when I'm not ready
Your hands will keep me steady

For the rest of my life
You will be my guide
Push me forward when I'm not ready
Your hands will keep me steady
