Title: Is It Too Late?
Writer: Daphne Link

You say you'll just have one more
You say one more and I'm out the door
You told me just one more game
Because this one won't be the same

You always procrastinate
But this time is it too late?
You always want to try again
But is it time to give in?

You took a chance on E
But ran out of gas with no money
Phone has 5 percent battery left
It died, no charger, you're distressed

You always procrastinate
But this time is it too late?
You always want to try again
But is it time to give in?

Sometimes you just get burned
Would happen left if you learned
You have to stop racing the clock
Stop putting up your own roadblocks

You always procrastinate
But this time is it too late?
You always want to try again
But is it time to give in?
