Title: Directions | Writer: Daphne Link

Today I'm feeling all alone
So, I look at the moon and know
I don't have to feel blue
Because we have the same view

We're headed in new directions
Learning to love our imperfections
And in due time, we'll be partners
Doing life together with his armor

(Instrumental)

We're headed in new directions
Learning to love our imperfections
And in due time, we'll be partners
Doing life together with his armor
