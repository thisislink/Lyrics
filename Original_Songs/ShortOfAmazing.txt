Title: Short Of Amazing
Writer: Daphne Link

We were broken and always complaining
For each other we were short of amazing

Together we planted a garden
Secretly knowing we'd stay guarded
You saw a future with a good wife
I saw days without you, a new life

We were broken and always complaining
For each other we were short of amazing
There were times we never felt more alive
But mostly we were emotionally deprived

We were broken and always complaining
For each other we were short of amazing

It was always hardest in the evenings
Our conversations were fleeting
I never embraced being your partner
You never removed your suit of armor

We were broken and always complaining
For each other we were short of amazing
There were times we never felt more alive
But mostly we were emotionally deprived

We were broken and always complaining
For each other we were short of amazing
There were times we never felt more alive
But mostly we were emotionally deprived

We were broken and always complaining
For each other we were short of amazing
