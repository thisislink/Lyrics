Title: Love Letters | Writer: Daphne Link

I've written quite a few
Love letters to you
I keep them in an old shoe box
I call it my heart jukebox

I think of you to fill my heart
Writing to you is where I start
When I need a sweet melody
Love letters become the recipe

Thoughts of you start my day
Do I make sense, what I'm trying to say?
I want to share my life with you
So, this one thing I continue to do

I think of you to fill my heart
Writing to you is where I start
When I need a sweet melody
Love letters become the recipe

If this has been subtle
Let me clear the rubble
Writing is more than something to do
I write because I love you

I think of you to fill my heart
Writing to you is where I start
When I need a sweet melody
Love letters become the recipe
