Title: Lentils | Writer: Daphne Link

There's a food
That really kills my mood
I never eat it for fun
I look at it and I'm done

I don't like lentils
They taste like pencils
Just give me chips
With all the unhealthiness

I won't get out of bed for this
This is the kinda food to dismiss
If I were really hungry
This still wouldn't be the food for me

I don't like lentils
They taste like pencils
Just give me chips
With all the unhealthiness
