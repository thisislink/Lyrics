Title: That Was a Day | Writer: Daphne Link

Let's hangout, take a trip
We did, per the usual, it was a riot
We didn't even hold hands
Instead we got lost in our plans

Nothings come close to beating it
Everything else is counterfeit
There's nothing more to say
Except, that was a day
Yeah, that was a day

I know I like bookstores and magic
You like it, because it's kinda romantic
And how we connect we can't ignore
Great food and conversation,
what more could you ask for?

Nothings come close to beating it
Everything else is counterfeit
There's nothing more to say
Except, that was a day
Yeah, that was a day

Let's do it again
A new day and new adventure
Filled with nothing but splendor

Let's do it again
A new day and new adventure
Filled with nothing but splendor

Until then

Nothings come close to beating it
Everything else is counterfeit
There's nothing more to say
Except, that was a day
Yeah, that was a day
