Title: Crush On You | Writer: Daphne Link

When I met you
I didn't think anything of it
You were just a new hire
But I noticed you had some whit

We have things in common
And when we don't
We give each other a hard time
And it's awesome

I have no plans to tell you
I have a crush on you
I like the way things are
So I'm keeping it to myself
That you're my shooting star

Several years have passed
I'm still having a blast
I love that you don't know
Like the location of Carmen Sandiego
