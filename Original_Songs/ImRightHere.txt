Title: I'm Right Here
Writer: Daphne Link

Everyday you're pushing me
Trying to help me succeed
You've got me convinced
You're the only one I need

When I'm sinking like the Titanic
Your words rescue me and calm my panic
When my mind is less than clear
You tell me don't worry I'm right here

On days when the jury is out for me
You're my home to block out the negativity
When I'm nervous about my ambitions
You tell me you'll help me with the provisions

When I'm sinking like the Titanic
Your words rescue me and calm my panic
When my mind is less than clear
You tell me don't worry I'm right here

Everyday you're pushing me
Trying to help me succeed
You've got me convinced
You're the only one I need

When I'm sinking like the Titanic
Your words rescue me and calm my panic
When my mind is less than clear
You tell me don't worry I'm right here
