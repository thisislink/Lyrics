Title: Lowkey | Writer: Daphne Link

You said let’s get outta here
You’re done being everyone’s puppeteer
I said ok but let’s go slow
I don’t want this to be a big show

I said no need to bring a crowd
I’m trying to keep the noise down
Let’s just keep it lowkey
It’s how I like it to be

We packed one bag and hit the road
Thought about saying bye, 
but didn’t wanna gloat
You seemed sad to leave this way
I knew,
it wouldn’t be long before you ran away

I said no need to bring a crowd
I’m trying to keep the noise down
Let’s just keep it lowkey
It’s how I like it to be

We went back at the end of summer
But I could no longer be your lover
We stayed close for a short while
But I slowly drifted off lowkey style

I said no need to bring a crowd
I’m trying to keep the noise down
Let’s just keep it lowkey
It’s how I like it to be

I said no need to bring a crowd
I’m trying to keep the noise down
Let’s just keep it lowkey
It’s how I like it to be
