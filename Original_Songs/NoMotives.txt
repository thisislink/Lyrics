Title: No Motives | Writer: Daphne Link

Put me on the stand
I'll disclose my one plan
Not looking for material things
Looking to hug away life's stings

Love like Him is what I wanna give
No motives is how I want to live
I want to love you expecting nothing
I hope you never see it coming

The grass could be greener over there
Feel free to go, don't despair
Because if you find it's not for you
I'll be here, open arms you can run into

Love like Him is what I wanna give
No motives is how I want to live
I want to love you expecting nothing
I hope you never see it coming
