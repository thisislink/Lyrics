Title: How We Deal
Writer: Daphne Link

How we deal with how we feel
Isn't always beauty and sex appeal
But what's revealed from within
Soothes the soul like an orchestra of violins

You're gonna have days you feel ugly
Like you belong in a zoo with monkeys
Some days negativity will rush in like a flood
You'll struggle to see the flower through the bud

How we deal with how we feel
Isn't always beauty and sex appeal
But what's revealed from within
Soothes the soul like an orchestra of violins

(Instrumental)

How we deal with how we feel
Isn't always beauty and sex appeal
But what's revealed from within
Soothes the soul like an orchestra of violins
