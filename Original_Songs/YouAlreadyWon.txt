Title: You Already Won | Writer: Daphne Link

I only have a couple things to say
So you can get on with your day
First, it’s a great day to be alive
So you can celebrate your life

Act like you already won
And the best scene is yet to come
Your positivity will be so dope
You’ll be their light of hope

The second thing is a reminder
To always be a little more kinder
You may have heard these things before
Maybe this time you’ll act, not ignore

Act like you already won
And the best scene is yet to come
Your positivity will be so dope
You’ll be their light of hope
You’ll be their light of hope
