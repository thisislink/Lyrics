Title: In Your Eyes
Writer: Daphne Link

The sunrise is what I see
When you're with me
You put the music in my heart
Number 1 on the Billboard charts

When I look into your eyes
Franz Mesmer, I'm hypnotized

In Your Eyes
In Your Eyes
In Your Eyes
In Your Eyes

There's no going back
You've got me in your trap
With every glance I moved closer
No time to think it over

When I look into your eyes
Franz Mesmer, I'm hypnotized

In Your Eyes
In Your Eyes
In Your Eyes
In Your Eyes

In Your Eyes
In Your Eyes
In Your Eyes
In Your Eyes
