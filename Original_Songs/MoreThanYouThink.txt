Title: More Than You Think | Writer: Daphne Link

In the shower
Is where thinking takes place
Is it water or tears
Running down your face

Take a second when you're on the brink
Know you can handle more than you think
Get right back up when you slip
And walk away better equipped

Lost and confused you want to get away
Where to go when your heart wants to stay
As you drive cars speed past you
You wonder what more in life can you do

Take a second when you're on the brink
Know you can handle more than you think
Get right back up when you slip
And walk away better equipped

Take a second when you're on the brink
Know you can handle more than you think
Get right back up when you slip
And walk away better equipped

Take a second 
Take a second

Take a second when you're on the brink
Know you can handle more than you think
