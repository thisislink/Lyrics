# Title: Good Reason

When I met you I thought I'd bomb it

But when we talked, you blew my mind like a comet

You started a fire in my heart

My past like a Picasso but you saw me like a fine art


Let us just ease in

We have good reason

Love evergreen like Sequoia seasons

We have good reason


You told me about your dream wedding

Sunset and white dress with lovely threading

The stars couldn't feel closer

With deep breaths we kept our composure


Let us just ease in

We have good reason

Love evergreen like Sequoia seasons

We have good reason


Even in our silence

I see us smiling

Even in our silence

I see us smiling


Let us just ease in

We have good reason

Love evergreen like Sequoia seasons

We have good reason
