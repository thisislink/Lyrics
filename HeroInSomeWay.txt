Title: Hero In Some Way
Writer: Daphne Link

Brunette all alone with headphones on in the quad
You wonder what she listens to on her ipod
You walk over and offer her your fruit cocktail
She smiles like she has secrets she'll never unveil

It doesn't take much to be nice
No need to think twice
Because someone somewhere isn't okay
But you can be a hero in some way

Your coworker is always such a jerk
The opposite of 4th of July fireworks
You invite him to after work dinner
He accepts, smirks and says he drinks a lot of liquor

It doesn't take much to be nice
No need to think twice
Because someone somewhere isn't okay
But you can be a hero in some way

If you're first to swing the hammer
Don't be the one to make them shatter

It doesn't take much to be nice
No need to think twice
Because someone somewhere isn't okay
But you can be a hero in some way

If you're first to swing the hammer
Don't be the one to make them shatter
If you're first to swing the hammer
Don't be the one to make them shatter
