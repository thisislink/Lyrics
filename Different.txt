Title: Different
Writer: Daphne Link

I was at the end of my rope
But you gave me hope

I was unsure about my future
You entered life, became my tutor

You showed me through my strife
I was worthy of eternal life

You're more than my teacher
And everyday I love you deeper

Even when I was weaker
I was always a seeker

When I need your guidance
Your response is never silence
