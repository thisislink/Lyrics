Title: Shadow
Writer: Daphne Link

When love is real you'll know
It'll be permanent like a shadow
You can't flush it down the toilet
And no moment will ever be pointless

To the world it'll seem synthetic
Those closest will even be a skeptic
To the world it'll seem synthetic
Those closest will even be a skeptic

When love is real you'll know
It'll be permanent like a shadow
You can't flush it down the toilet
And no moment will ever be pointless
