Title: I.M.P.R.O.V.E.
Writer: Daphne Link

I never liked the saying
You should reach for the stars
For me it's too limiting
To seek what's in front of the visible doors

I.M.P.R.O.V.E.
On that next level's where I'm gonna be
I'm in no rush, I placed bets on me
My hand's a royal flush I'm playing slowly


Making people smile is my mission
I'm trying to be your resident music physician




I don't have dreams to play in big stadiums
The crowd doesn't need to love me




planet
earth
mars


Some say to reach for the stars
I'm trying to reach beyond mars






fire
burn
smoke
stars
sky
clouds
brakes
