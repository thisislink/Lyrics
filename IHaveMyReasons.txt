Title: I Have My Reasons
Writer: Daphne Link

Woke up today feeling insane
Feeling like jumping on a runaway train
I don't wanna look lame
Don't think I can take the shame

So let's do more than just survive
Trying to see that forever sunrise
These aren't one season feelings
Can't say how I know but I have my reasons

You walk into the room like 'you the one'
Immediately I start coming undone
I'm trying to get more than your number
Wanna love you after the summer

So let's do more than just survive
Trying to see that forever sunrise

So let's do more than just survive
Trying to see that forever sunrise

I said

So let's do more than just survive
Trying to see that forever sunrise
These aren't one season feelings
Can't say how I know but I have my reasons
