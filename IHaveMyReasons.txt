Title: I Have My Reasons
Writer: Daphne Link


Woke up today feeling so constrained
So overwhelmed I'm getting a migraine

We try to outrun the pain
Wanna jump on a runaway train 
Trying to escape the ball and chain


Don't wanna look lame
You can't take the shame
You walk into the room with a false name

You throw on a dark jacket 
Walk head down and black sunglasses 

Your words hurt like rays from the sun
I'm starting to come undone

Trying to get more than your number
Wanna love you after the summer

Wanna do more than just survive
Trying to see that forever sunrise

These aren't one season feelings
Can't say how I know
But I have my reasons
