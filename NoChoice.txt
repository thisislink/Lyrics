Title: No Choice


You thought you had to copy her
But it made you basic like lined paper

When you're walking through neighborhoods
You dream of a life in the woods

You're expected to be the life of the party
Inside you feel like a dried out sharpie

Everyday you try not to turn away
But every breath is pushed through a narrow airway

Everything about the encounter was brief
Damaged by the wreckage left by a thief
