Title: No Choice
Writer: Daphne Link

You thought you had to copy her
But it made you basic like lined paper
Darkness had you walking in the hoods
Glorifying of a death in the woods

You fell by the wayside
Living a life of lies and pride
Then when all that was left was a voice to rejoice
You found you had no choice

People expect you to be the life of the party
Inside you feel like a dried out sharpie
Everyday you try not to turn away
But every breath is pushed through a narrow airway

You fell by the wayside
Living a life of lies and pride
Then when all that was left was a voice to rejoice
You found you had no choice

Every human encounter was brief
Damaged by the wreckage left by a thief, So

You fell by the wayside
Living a life of lies and pride
Then when all that was left was a voice to rejoice
You found you had no choice
