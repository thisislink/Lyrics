Title: Not Done | Writer: Daphne Link

Coasted through most of your life
Had a little fun and a lot of strife 
You’re starting to think this is it
Money, love, and happiness must be a myth

Your story’s not done
It’s only just begun
And as long as you’re still breathing
One day you’ll see your life has meaning

Turn the alarm off, wake up, go to work
No one said as an adult you’d be overworked
Even food reaches a point of done
You can’t continue to feel this numb

Your story’s not done
It’s only just begun
And as long as you’re still breathing
One day you’ll see your life has meaning

Your story’s not done
It’s only just begun
And as long as you’re still breathing
One day you’ll see your life has meaning
